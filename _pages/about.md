<!--- Researcher-Lecturer of Automation and Robotics -->

I am currently a Lead R&D Control Engineer at [Cailabs](https://www.cailabs.com/).

I am currently a Lecturer in Robotics and Control Engineering at [Cardiff Metropolitan University](https://www.cardiffmet.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx).

Short Bio
======

I hold a BSc in Industrial Electronics and Control Engineering from the [Faculty of Electronic Engineering](http://mu.menofia.edu.eg/fee/Home/en), [Menoufia University](http://mu.menofia.edu.eg/Home/en), where I began my academic journey as a teaching assistant. I then obtained my MSc and PhD degrees in Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering from the [Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology](https://ejust.edu.eg/) and [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/), specializing in aerial manipulators.

I was appointed as a Lecturer in Automation and Robotics and engaged in cutting-edge research on multi-drone formation control at Menoufia University. During this time, I also expanded my teaching portfolio by joining the [French University in Egypt](http://www.ufe.edu.eg/) and [Zewail City for Science and Technology](https://www.zewailcity.edu.eg/main/index.php?lang=en) as an adjunct lecturer.

Later, I took on a postdoctoral researcher role at [Ecole Centrale de Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/) as part of the [Valet](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/Project-ANR-15-CE22-0013) project, where I designed advanced motion control algorithms for car-like vehicle platoons operating in urban environments. Subsequently, I joined [Lynxdrone](https://lynxdrone.fr/) as the R&D Manager and Research Scientist, leading innovations in robotics and drone technologies.

I also served as a Researcher and Lecturer in Robotics and Control Engineering at [Cardiff Metropolitan University](https://www.cardiffmet.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx), where I furthered my research in control systems. Currently, I work as a Control Engineer, addressing complex control challenges in optical telecommunication systems.


Research Interests
======

My research interests, based on an interdisciplinary approach, span the areas of Control Theory, Mechatronics, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I have a specific interest in the design, analysis and motion control of robotic systems including:
* Robust, optimal, predictive, cooperative and distributed control;
* Homogeneous/Heterogeneous Cooperative Robots;
* Subterranean Robots;
* AI-based motion control algorithms.
