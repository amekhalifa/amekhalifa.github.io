<!--- Researcher-Lecturer of Automation and Robotics -->


I currently serve as a Principal Investigator and Control Systems Engineer at [Cailabs](https://www.cailabs.com/), where I lead the development and implementation of advanced control systems for optical applications, with a strong emphasis on enhancing performance and reliability. My responsibilities include driving research initiatives in control theory, optimization, and machine learning, and designing innovative solutions tailored to the unique challenges of optical technologies.


## Short Bio

I hold a BSc in Industrial Electronics and Control Engineering from the [Faculty of Electronic Engineering](http://mu.menofia.edu.eg/fee/Home/en), [Menoufia University](http://mu.menofia.edu.eg/Home/en). I then obtained my MSc and PhD degrees in Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering from the [Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology](https://ejust.edu.eg/) and [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/), specializing in aerial manipulators.

I was appointed as a Lecturer in Automation and Robotics at Menoufia University and engaged in cutting-edge research on multi-drone formation control with Keio University. During this time, I also expanded my teaching portfolio by joining the [French University in Egypt](http://www.ufe.edu.eg/) and [Zewail City for Science and Technology](https://www.zewailcity.edu.eg/main/index.php?lang=en) as an adjunct lecturer.

Later, I took on a postdoctoral researcher role at [Ecole Centrale de Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/) as part of the [Valet](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/Project-ANR-15-CE22-0013) project, where I designed advanced motion control algorithms for car-like vehicle platoons operating in urban environments. Subsequently, I joined [Lynxdrone](https://lynxdrone.fr/) as R&D Manager and Research Scientist, leading innovations in robotics and drone technologies.

I also served as a Researcher and Lecturer in Robotics and Control Engineering at [Cardiff Metropolitan University](https://www.cardiffmet.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx), where I furthered my research in control systems for Subterranean Robotics for infrastructure inspection. Currently, I work as a lead R&D Control Engineer, addressing complex control challenges in optical telecommunication systems.


## Research Interests

I have a diverse range of research interests that adopt an interdisciplinary approach, integrating Control Theory, Optimization, Mechatronics, Robotics, and Machine Learning (AI). My specific areas of focus include:

- Developing optimal, predictive, and distributed control strategies
- Exploring cooperative systems involving homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-agent configurations
- Designing machine learning-based control algorithms that enhance system performance

I am passionate about leveraging these fields to address complex engineering challenges and contribute to advancements in automation and intelligent systems.
