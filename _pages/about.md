<!--- Researcher-Lecturer of Automation and Robotics -->

I am currently a Lecturer in Robotics and Control Engineering at [Cardiff Metropolitan University](https://www.cardiffmet.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx).

Short Bio
======

Ahmed holds a BSc degree in Industrial Electronics and Control Engineering from [Faculty of Electronic Engineering](http://mu.menofia.edu.eg/fee/Home/en), [Menoufia University](http://mu.menofia.edu.eg/Home/en) where he then worked as a teaching assistant. He got his MSc and PhD degrees in Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering from [Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology](https://ejust.edu.eg/) in 2013 and 2016 respectively in the field of Aerial Manipulators. While pursuing his PhD thesis, in 2015, he joined [Namerikawa Laboratory](http://www.namerikawa.sd.keio.ac.jp/) at [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/) as a PhD student. In November 2016, Ahmed was a lecturer in automation and robotics and a researcher in multi-drone formation control at the Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Menoufia University. Meanwhile, he joined the [French University in Egypt](http://www.ufe.edu.eg/) and [Zewail City for Science and Technology](https://www.zewailcity.edu.eg/main/index.php?lang=en) as an adjunct lecturer. In December 2017, he had postdoctoral researcher position at [Ecole Centrale de Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/) where he worked on the project [Valet](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/Project-ANR-15-CE22-0013) to design a motion control algorithm for car-like vehicles platoon navigating in urban environments. I am currently a Lecturer in Robotics and Control Engineering at [Cardiff Metropolitan University](https://www.cardiffmet.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx).

Research Interests
======

My research interests, based on an interdisciplinary approach, span the areas of Control Theory, Mechatronics, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I have a specific interest in the design, analysis and motion control of robotic systems including:
* Robust, optimal, predictive, cooperative and distributed control;
* Homogeneous/Heterogeneous Cooperative Robots;
* Subterranean Robots;
* AI-based motion control algorithms.
